goes well beyond being just another movie about musician hitchcock great director ironically mostly find his films total waste time watch secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie this pandering the audience that sabotages most his films hence the whole story lacks certain energy the plot simply rumbles like machine desperately depending the addition new scenes there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws mishima extremely uninteresting this chilly unremarkable movie about author living working chilly abstruse culture the flat reenactments don hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy and the rest just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves hairsplitting about purity the admiration swords etc can bore you pieces and kill the momentum movie quicker than anyone else schrader has made resume full lousy amateurish films when first watched this movie the loved was totally fascinated the music the dancing everything however recently watched the whole thing again dvd and was completely struck how extremely stupid the storyline was how contained holes inconsistencies and frankly whole lot crap and how horrid the dancing was mean realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic the character developments also lacked depth woa talk about awful not waste your time was just too horrible the worst sappiest dialogue could and but what really made unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you can even tell they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines speak but the director gave them action you check the director filmography this site you will see why this film didn have chance this would not even good made for flick good intentions made film great then this film might one the greatest films ever made the film has great actors master director significant theme least would significant theme undertone fifties existential world weariness aerial scenes that ought have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care regrettably the film fails the movie lacks visual interest drama expression feeling and celebration the very patriotism that underlines the narrative actress has been worse used that june allison this movie yet enjoy watching unfortunately this bad movie that just plain bad bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad the dialogue sucked the cinematography can called that sucked the soundtrack sucked the acting sucked the concert sequences just sucked that was nice that was funny was funny overall this movie was cheap trash but this movie not funny considering the ridiculousness came out feeling angry spoilers whatever else can can said about surface superbly crafted the cinematography simply stunning say the least and the are nothing not state the art conceptually the show offers little bit everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy and fans and there wasn single sour note struck acting wise either some surprisingly solid casting here all things considered job very well done thanks good movie like this was done and released one the best mexican movies ever and one the less understood even mexican themselves matter how identified the should have felt with ranks highly great noir crime drama incredible performances belmondo and lino ventura the attention given every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous excellent drama excellent thriller and excellent film there with the best melville everything about this film simply incredible you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul child black water thriller that manages completely transcend limitations indie flick continually subverting expectations emerge intense experience the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile extremely well done indeed the black water website believed that because they used real crocs and the swamp location fabulous thoroughly enjoyed when christopher eccleston took control the tardis and the continuation the series not sure what was trying with this film was turn good day feeling into night disturbing memories than guess succeeded there lot beautiful places was forced like everything this movie again lame here where the movie really off and don even get started the jerky camerawork when saw the theater thought was going sick summary the witticisms weren witty the plot well said let that one the acting was bad really bad even billy bob couldn rise above the script which was worse camerawork again bad rating out amazing finale possibly the best trilogy all time kieslowski never ceases amaze one favourite directors and one the most talented directors the history cinema his use the colours the french flag the three films was nothing short incredible every shot every scene was like work art three the most visually appealing movies ever seen and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome have mention this and huge spoiler loved the ending how all the characters the three films were the remaining survivors the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching her solidifying his happiness over the suffering which dealt with for those many years couldn think better way end the film but smile face great way wrap amazing film and trilogy recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anything work art out for both the movie and trilogy literally vomited while watching this film think was one the people who found this another one roth pearls his performance awarded was stunning the story which was told eloquently francis ford coppola years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters develop most wonderful location lies story contrast all all beautiful directed film from nicola roeg wih sublime cast translating movies for living and this the first movie year working experience that found offensive intelligence but when someone strives for greatness
